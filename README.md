# Webtools

These are text tools that can be used in a browser without internet nor a (local) web server (using the file:// protocol)

The only file really needed to use the webtools is [tools.html](docs/webtools/tools.html)

The main part of the code for this repo can be found in the [webtools](docs/webtools) folder, this also includes some examples and regex/xpath docs

These webtools are hosted on the web at this address: <https://koenbeek.github.io> - i.e. the [docs folder](docs)

Recommended/Tested browser is chrome

Tests can be executed with "`npm t`"

Build can be executed with "`npm run build`"

The GIT and deployment flow used is described [here](GIT)
